Manifests for pseudo-design-linux development.

Don't clone this repository directly.  Instead use [repo](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo).  Run the following in an empty directory to get started:


`repo init -u git@github.com:PseudoDesign/pseudo-design-linux-manifest.git -b scarthgap`

`repo sync`

This will create a README.md in your directory -- read that for next steps.
